Background
**********

What is Flux Framework?
=======================

Flux is a flexible framework for resource management, built for your site.
The core framework here consists of a suite of projects, tools, and libraries that may be used to build site-custom resource managers for
High Performance Computing centers. The set of core projects are described in this documentation, and our
larger family of projects can be seen on `our portal page <https://flux-framework.org>`_.

What does it mean for a cluster to deploy Flux?
===============================================

Most of the time when someone talks about Flux, they will be describing the combined install
of several projects here that manifest in a full cluster to submit workflows.
This cluster is comparable to other job managers like Slurm or SGE in that it can be installed
as the main workload manager for a site.

Where does Flux work?
=====================

You likely are associating Flux with high performance computing in that it is comparable
to other job managers. However, Flux has a unique ability to nest, meaning you (as a user) could
launch a Flux Instance under a Slurm allocation, for example. Along with scheduler nesting,
you can easily demo Flux in a container, or even used in Kubernetes with the
`Flux Operator <https://flux-framework.org/flux-operator>`_. We have a vision for Flux to
allow for converged computing, or making it easy to move between traditional HPC and cloud.

How does Flux compare to other managers?
========================================

Flux has similarities to many other resource managers, but we do a variety of things quite differently.
Check out this comparison table here (:ref:`comparison-table`) for a detailed list!"

*****************
General Questions
*****************

.. _fluid_encoding:

What's with the fancy ∆í?
========================

Flux job IDs and their multiple encodings are described in
`RFC 19 <https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-rfc/en/latest/spec_19.html>`_.  The ``∆í`` prefix denotes the start of the F58 job ID encoding.
Flux tries to determine if the current locale supports UTF-8 multi-byte
characters before using ``∆í``, and if it cannot, substitutes the alternate
ASCII ``f`` character.  If necessary, you may coerce the latter by setting
``FLUX_F58_FORCE_ASCII=1`` in your environment.

Most flux tools accept a job ID in any valid encoding.  You can convert from
F58 to another using the :core:man1:`flux-job` ``id`` subcommand, e.g.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ flux submit sleep 3600 | flux job id --to=words
   airline-alibi-index--tuna-maximum-adam
   $ flux job cancel airline-alibi-index--tuna-maximum-adam

With copy-and-paste, auto-completion, globbing, etc., it shouldn't be necessary
to *type* a job ID with the ``∆í`` prefix that often, but should you need to,
use your terminal's method for inputting a
`Unicode U+0192 <https://codepoints.net/U+0192?lang=en>`_:

gnome terminal
   Press ``ctrl`` + ``shift`` + ``U`` then type ``0192`` and press ``space``
   or ``enter``.

mac
   Press ``option`` + ``f``.

If your `Konsole <https://konsole.kde.org/>`_ terminal displays ``∆í`` as ``√Ü``,
check that Settings ‚Üí  Edit ‚Üí  Profile ‚Üí  Advanced ‚Üí  Encoding: Default
Character Encoding is set to ``UTF-8``, not ``ISO8859-1``.

.. _flux_run_mac:

Does flux run on a Mac?
=======================

Not yet. We have an open `issue <https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/2892>`_
on GitHub tracking the progress towards the goal of natively compiling on a
mac. In the meantime, you can use Docker, see: :ref:`quickstart`.

.. _flux_shell_prompt:

Can you recommend a shell prompt?
=================================

It can sometimes be tricky dealing with Flux hierarchies of instances.  A common
shell prompt adjustment used by Flux users adds Flux resource size and
instance depth into the prompt.  For example, the following prompt shows that
we have 64 nodes of resources and are at depth 1.

.. code-block:: console

    [s=64,d=1] $

To add this prompt into your shell, you can cut and paste the below or use it to
adjust your current shell prompt.  Note that the initial call to ``flux getattr size``
is simply used to test if you are currently running on a system with Flux or not.

Cut and paste for ``.bashrc``

.. code-block:: sh

    flux getattr size > /dev/null 2>&1
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        export PS1="[s=$(flux getattr size),d=$(flux getattr instance-level)] $"
    fi

Cut and paste for ``.cshrc``

.. code-block:: sh

    flux getattr size >& /dev/null
    if ( $? == 0 ) then
        set prompt="[s=`flux getattr size`,d=`flux getattr instance-level`] $"
    endif

.. _bug_report_how:

How do I report a bug?
======================

You can read up on reporting bugs here: :ref:`contributing` or report one
directly for flux `core <https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues>`_
or `sched <https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues>`_.

*******************
Resources Questions
*******************

.. _not_managing_all_resources:

Why is Flux ignoring my Nvidia GPUs?
====================================

When Flux is launched via a foreign resource manager like Slurm or LSF,
it must discover available resources from scratch using
`hwloc <https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/>`_.  To print a resource
summary, run:

.. code-block:: sh

  $ flux resource info
  16 Nodes, 96 Cores, 16 GPUs

The version of hwloc that Flux is using at runtime must have been configured
with ``--enable-cuda`` for it to be able to detect Nvidia GPUs.  You can test
to see if hwloc is able to detect installed GPUs with:

.. code-block:: sh

  $ lstopo | grep CoProc

If no output is produced, then hwloc does not see any Nvidia GPUs.

This problem manifests itself differently on a Flux system instance where *R*
(the resource set) is configured, or when Flux receives *R* as an allocation
from the enclosing Flux instance.  In these cases Flux checks *R* against
resources reported by hwloc, and drains any nodes that have missing resources.

.. _missing_resources:

Why are resources missing in foreign-launched Flux?
===================================================

When Flux discovers resources via
`hwloc <https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/>`_, it honors the current
core and GPU bindings, so if resources are missing, affinity and binding
from the parent resource manager should be checked.  In Slurm, try
``--mpibind=off``, in LSF jsrun, try ``--bind=none``.


.. _overcommit_resources:

How can I oversubscribe tasks to resources in Flux?
===================================================

There are several ways to decouple a job's task count from the quantity
of allocated resources, depending on what you want to do.

If you simply want to oversubscribe tasks to resources, you can use the
per-resource options of the job submission commands instead of the more common
per-task options.  For example, to launch 100 tasks per node across 2 nodes:

.. code-block:: console

  $ flux run --tasks-per-node=100 -N2 COMMAND

The per-resource options were added in flux-core 0.43.0.
In earlier versions, the same effect can be achieved by setting the
``per-resource.`` job shell options directly:

.. code-block:: console

 $ flux run -o per-resource.type=node -o per-resource.count=100 -N2 COMMAND

Another method to more generally oversubscribe resources is to launch
multiple Flux brokers per node. This can be done locally for testing, e.g.

.. code-block:: console

 $ flux start -s 4

or can be done by launching a job with multiple ``flux start`` commands
per node, e.g. to run 8 brokers across 2 nodes

.. code-block:: console

 $ flux submit -o cpu-affinity=off -N2 -n8 flux start SCRIPT

One final method is to use the ``alloc-bypass``
`jobtap plugin <https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-core/en/latest/man7/flux-jobtap-plugins.html>`_, which allows a job to bypass the
scheduler entirely by supplying its own resource set. When this plugin
is loaded, an instance owner can submit a job with the
``system.alloc-bypass.R`` attribute set to a valid
`Resource Set Specification <https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-rfc/en/latest/spec_20.html>`_. The job will then be executed
immediately on the specified resources. This is useful for co-locating
a job with another job, e.g. to run debugger or other services.

.. code-block:: console

 $ flux jobtap load alloc-bypass.so
 $ flux submit -N4 sleep 60
 ∆í2WU24J4NT
 $ flux run --setattr=system.alloc-bypass.R="$(flux job info ∆í2WU24J4NT R)" -n 4 flux getattr rank

.. _node_memory_exhaustion:

How do I prevent Flux from filling up /tmp?
===========================================

Flux's key value store is backed by an `SQLite <https://www.sqlite.org>`_
database file, located by default in *rundir*, typically ``/tmp``.  On some
systems, ``/tmp`` is a RAM-backed file system with limited space, and in
some situations such as long running, high throughput workflows, Flux may
use a lot of it.

Flux may be launched with the database file redirected to another location
by setting the *statedir* broker attribute.  For example:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ mkdir -p /home/myuser/jobstate
    $ rm -f /home/myuser/jobstate/content.sqlite
    $ flux batch --broker-opts=-Sstatedir=/home/myuser/jobdir -N16 ...

Or if launching via :core:man1:`flux-start` use:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ flux start -o,-Sstatedir=/home/myuser/jobdir

Note the following:

* The database is only accessed by rank 0 so *statedir* need not be shared
  with the other ranks.
* *statedir* must exist before starting Flux.
* If *statedir* contains ``content.sqlite`` it will be reused.  Unless you are
  intentionally restarting on the same nodes, remove it before starting Flux.
* Unlike *rundir*, *statedir* and the ``content.sqlite`` file within it
  are not cleaned up when Flux exits.

See also: :core:man7:`flux-broker-attributes`.

Jobs Questions
**************

.. _launch_large_num_jobs:

How do I efficiently launch a large number of jobs?
===================================================

If you have more than 10K fast-cycling jobs to run, here are some tips that
may help improve efficiency and throughput:

- Create a batch job or allocation to contain the jobs in a Flux subinstance.
  This improves performance over submitting them directly to the Flux system
  instance and reduces the impact of your jobs on system resources and other
  users.  See also: :ref:`batch`.
- If scripting ``flux submit`` commands, avoid the pattern of one command
  per job as each command invocation has a startup cost.  Instead try to
  combine similar job submissions with ``flux submit --cc=IDSET``
  or :core:man1:`flux-builksubmit`.
- By default ``flux submit --cc=IDSET`` and ``flux bulksubmit``
  will exit once all jobs have been submitted.  To wait for all jobs to
  complete before proceeding, use the ``--wait`` or ``--watch`` options to
  these tools.
- If multiple commands must be used to submit jobs before waiting for them,
  consider using ``--flags=waitable`` and ``flux job wait --all`` to wait for
  jobs to complete and capture any errors.
- If the jobs to be submitted cannot be combined with the command line tools,
  develop a workflow management script using the
  `Flux python interface <https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-core/en/latest/python/index.html>`_.  The
  `flux-run <https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/blob/master/src/cmd/flux-run.py>`_
  command itself is a python program that can be a useful reference.
- If jobs produce a significant amount of standard I/O, use the
  :core:man1:`flux-submit` ``--output`` option to redirect it to files.  By
  default, standard I/O is captured in the Flux key value store, which holds
  other job metadata and may become a bottleneck if jobs generate a large
  amount of output.
- When handling many fast-cycling jobs, the rank 0 Flux broker may require
  significant memory and cpu.  Consider excluding that node from scheduling
  with ``flux resource drain 0``.

Since Flux can be launched as a parallel job within foreign resource managers
like Slurm and LSF, your efforts to develop an efficient batch or workflow
management script that runs within a Flux instance can be portable to those
systems.


.. _mimic_slurm_jobstep:

How do I run job steps?
=======================

A Flux batch job or allocation started with ``flux batch`` or
``flux alloc`` is actually a full featured Flux instance run as a job
within the enclosing Flux instance.  Unlike Slurm, Flux does not have a
separate concept like *steps* for work run in a Flux subinstance--we just have
*jobs*.  That said, a batch script in Flux may contain multiple
``flux run`` commands just as a Slurm batch script may contain multiple
``srun`` commands.

Despite there being only one type of *job* in Flux, running a series of jobs
within a Flux subinstance confers several advantages over running them
directly in the Flux system instance:

- System prolog and epilog scripts typically run before and after each job
  in the system instance, but are skipped between jobs within a subinstance.
- The Flux system instance services all users and active jobs running at that
  level, but the subinstance operates independently and is yours alone.
- Flux accounting may enforce a maximum job count at the system instance level,
  but the subinstance counts as a single job no matter how many jobs are run
  within it.
- The user has full administrative control over the Flux subinstance, whereas
  "guests" have limited access to the system instance.

Flux's nesting design makes it possible to be quite sophisticated in how
jobs running in a Flux subinstance are scheduled and managed, since all
Flux tools and APIs work the same in any Flux instance.

See also: :ref:`batch`.

.. _pending_hang:

Why is my job not running?
==========================

If :core:man1:`flux-jobs` shows your job in one of the pending states, you
can probe deeper to understand what is going on.  First, run ``flux-jobs``
with a custom output format that shows more detail about pending states,
for example:

.. code-block:: console

  $ flux jobs --format="{id.f58:>12} {name:<10.10} {urgency:<3} {priority:<12} {state:<8.8} {dependencies}"
           JOBID NAME       URG PRI          STATE    DEPENDENCIES
     ∆íABLQgbbf3d sleep      16  16           SCHED
     ∆íABLQty9fSX sleep      16  16           SCHED
     ∆íABLR7sqQkf sleep      16  16           SCHED
     ∆íABLRJnt85u sleep      16  16           SCHED
     ∆íABLRVunjfu sleep      16  16           SCHED
     ∆íABLRgR7eVd sleep      16  16           SCHED
     ∆íABLQJnzDfV sleep      16  16           RUN

The job state machine is defined in
`RFC 21 <https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-rfc/en/latest/spec_21.html>`_.
Normally a job advances from NEW to DEPEND, PRIORITY, SCHED, RUN, CLEANUP, and
finally INACTIVE.  A job can be blocked in any of the following states:

DEPEND
  The job is awaiting resolution of a dependency.  A job submitted without
  explicit dependencies may still acquire them.  For example, flux-accounting
  may add a ``max-running-jobs-user-limit`` dependency when a user has too many
  jobs running, and resolve it once some jobs complete.

PRIORITY
  The job is awaiting priority assignment.  Flux-accounting may hold a job in
  this state if the user's bank is not yet configured.

SCHED
  The job is waiting for the scheduler to allocate resources.  A job may be
  held this state indefinitely by setting its *urgency* to zero.  Otherwise,
  the scheduler decides which job to run next depending on the job's *priority*
  value, availability of the requested resources, and the scheduler's algorithm.

Note that the job's priority value defaults to the urgency, but a Flux system
instance may be configured to use the flux-accounting multi-factor priority
plugin, which sets priority based on factors that include historical and
administrative information such as bank assignments and allocations.

The job state transitions are driven by job *events*, also defined in `RFC 21
<https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-rfc/en/latest/spec_21.html>`_.
Sometimes it is helpful to see the detailed events when diagnosing a
stuck job.  A job eventlog can be printed using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ flux job eventlog --time-format=offset ∆íABFhJBw1dh
  0.000000 submit userid=5588 urgency=16 flags=0 version=1
  0.014319 validate
  0.027185 depend
  0.027262 priority priority=16

This job is blocked in the SCHED state, having not yet received an allocation
from the scheduler.  Job events may also be viewed in real time when a job is
submitted with ``flux run``, for example:

.. code-block:: console

  $ flux run -vv -N2 sleep 60
  jobid: ∆íABKQfqHf3u
  0.000s: job.submit {"userid":5588,"urgency":16,"flags":0,"version":1}
  0.015s: job.validate
  0.028s: job.depend
  0.028s: job.priority {"priority":16}
  0.036s: job.alloc {"annotations":{"sched":{"queue":"debug"}}}
  0.037s: job.prolog-start {"description":"job-manager.prolog"}
  0.524s: job.prolog-finish {"description":"job-manager.prolog","status":0}
  0.538s: job.start

.. _parallel_run_hang:

Why is my running job stuck?
============================

If a job is getting to RUN state but still isn't getting started, it may be
helpful to look at job's exec eventlog, which is separate from the primary
eventlog described in :ref:`pending_hang`

.. code-block:: console

  $ flux job eventlog --path=guest.exec.eventlog --time-format=offset ∆íABaWMZ7UmD
  0.000000 init
  0.004929 starting
  0.348570 shell.init leader-rank=6 size=2 service="5588-shell-68203540434124800"
  0.358706 shell.start task-count=2
  2.360860 shell.task-exit localid=0 rank=0 state="Exited" pid=10034 wait_status=0 signaled=0 exitcode=0
  2.416990 complete status=0
  2.417061 done

These events may also be viewed in real time, combined with the primary
eventlog when a job is submitted by ``flux run``:

.. code-block:: console

  $ flux run -vvv -N2 sleep 2
  jobid: ∆íABaWMZ7UmD
  0.000s: job.submit {"userid":5588,"urgency":16,"flags":0,"version":1}
  0.015s: job.validate
  0.028s: job.depend
  0.028s: job.priority {"priority":16}
  0.038s: job.alloc {"annotations":{"sched":{"queue":"debug"}}}
  0.038s: job.prolog-start {"description":"job-manager.prolog"}
  0.520s: job.prolog-finish {"description":"job-manager.prolog","status":0}
  0.532s: job.start
  0.522s: exec.init
  0.527s: exec.starting
  0.871s: exec.shell.init {"leader-rank":6,"size":2,"service":"5588-shell-68203540434124800"}
  0.881s: exec.shell.start {"task-count":2}
  2.883s: exec.shell.task-exit {"localid":0,"rank":0,"state":"Exited","pid":10034,"wait_status":0,"signaled":0,"exitcode":0}
  2.939s: exec.complete {"status":0}
  2.939s: exec.done
  2.939s: job.finish {"status":0}

.. _bulksubmit_hang:

Why does the ``flux bulksubmit`` command hang?
===================================================

The ``flux bulksubmit`` command works similar to GNU parallel or
``xargs`` and is likely blocked waiting for input from ``stdin``.
Typical usage is to send output of some command to ``bulksubmit`` and,
like ``xargs -I``, substitute the input with ``{}``. For example:

.. code-block:: console

 $ seq 1 4 | flux bulksubmit --watch echo {}
 ∆í2jBnW4zK
 ∆í2jBoz4Gf
 ∆í2jBoz4Gg
 ∆í2jBoz4Gh
 1
 2
 3
 4

As an alternative to reading from ``stdin``, the ``bulksubmit`` utility can
also take inputs on the command line separated by ``:::``.

The ``--dry-run`` option to ``flux bulksubmit`` may be useful to
see what would be submitted to Flux without actually running any jobs

.. code-block:: console

 $ flux bulksubmit --dry-run echo {} ::: 1 2 3
 bulksubmit: submit echo 1
 bulksubmit: submit echo 2
 bulksubmit: submit echo 3

For more help and examples, see :core:man1:`flux-bulksubmit`.

*************
MPI Questions
*************

.. _mpi_bootstrap_fails:

How do I set MPI-specific options?
==================================

The environment that Flux presents to MPI is via the :core:man1:`flux-shell`,
which is the parent process of all MPI processes.  There is typically one
flux shell per node launched for each job.  A Flux shell plugin offers a
`PMI <https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-rfc/en/latest/spec_13.html>`_
server that MPI uses to bootstrap itself within the application's call to
``MPI_Init()``.  Several shell options affect the PMI implementations.

verbose=2
   If the shell verbosity level is set to 2 or greater, a trace of the
   PMI server operations is emitted to stderr, which can help debug an
   MPI application that is failing within ``MPI_Init()``.

pmi=off
   Disable all PMI implementations.

pmi=LIST
   By default, only ``simple`` PMI is offered.  If shell plugins for additonal
   implementations are installed, like for ``pmix`` or ``cray-pals``, set
   *LIST* to a comma-separated list of implementations to enable.

pmi-simple.nomap
   Populate neither the ``flux.taskmap`` nor ``PMI_process_mapping`` keys
   in the PMI kvs.

In addition to the PMI server, the shell implements "MPI personalities" as
lua scripts that are sourced by the shell.  Scripts for generic installs of
openmpi, Intel MPI are loaded by default from ``/etc/flux/shell/lua.d``.
Other personalities are optionally loaded from ``/etc/flux/shell/lua.d/mpi``:

mpi=none
   Disable the personality scripts that are normally loaded by default.

mpi=spectrum
   IBM Spectrum MPI is an OpenMPI derivative.  See also
   :ref:`coral_spectrum_mpi`.

MPI personality options may be added by site administrators, or by other
packages.

Example: launch a Spectrum MPI job with PMI tracing enabled:

.. code-block:: console

 $ flux run -ompi=spectrum -overbose=2 -n4 ./hello

.. _openmpi_versions:

What versions of OpenMPI work with Flux?
========================================

Flux plugins were added to OpenMPI 3.0.0.  Generally, these plugins enable
OpenMPI major versions 3 and 4 to work with Flux.  OpenMPI must be configured
with the Flux plugins enabled.  Your installed version may be checked with:

.. code-block:: console

 $ ompi_info|grep flux
                 MCA pmix: flux (MCA v2.1.0, API v2.0.0, Component v4.0.3)
               MCA schizo: flux (MCA v2.1.0, API v1.0.0, Component v4.0.3)

Unfortunately, `an OpenMPI bug <https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/6730>`_
broke the Flux plugins in OpenMPI versions 3.0.0-3.0.4, 3.1.0-3.1.4, and
4.0.0-4.0.1.  The `fix <https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/pull/6764/commits/d4070d5f58f0c65aef89eea5910b202b8402e48b>`_
was backported such that the 3.0.5+, 3.1.5+, and 4.0.2+ series do not
experience this issue.

A slightly different `OpenMPI bug <https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/pull/8380>`_
caused segfaults of MPI in ``MPI_Finalize`` when UCX PML was used.
`The fix <https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/pull/8380>`_ was backported to
4.0.6 and 4.1.1.  If you are using UCX PML in OpenMPI, we recommend using
4.0.6+ or 4.1.1+.

A special `job shell plugin <https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-pmix>`_,
offered as a separate package, is required to bootstrap the upcoming openmpi
5.0.x releases.  Once installed, the plugin is activated by submitting a job
with the ``-ompi=openmpi@5`` and/or ``-opmi=pmix`` options.

.. _openmpi_config:

How should I configure OpenMPI to work with Flux?
=================================================

There are many ways to configure OpenMPI, but a few configure options
deserve special mention if MPI programs are to be run by Flux:

enable-static
   One of the Flux MCA plugins uses ``dlopen()`` internally to access Flux's
   ``libpmi.so`` library, since unlike the MPICH-derivatives, OpenMPI does
   not have a built-in simple PMI client. This option prevents OpenMPI from
   using ``dlopen()`` so that MCA plugin will not be built.  Do not use.

with-flux-pmi
   Although the Flux MCA plugins are built by default, this is required to
   ensure configure fails if they cannot be built for some reason.

.. _openmpi_debug:

How do I make OpenMPI print debugging output?
=============================================

This is not a Flux question but it comes up often enough to mention here.
You may set OpenMPI MCA parameters via the environment by prefixing the
parameter with ``OMPI_MCA_``.  For example, to get verbose output from the
Block Transfer Layer (BTL), set the ``btl_base_verbose`` parameter to an
integer verbosity level, e.g.

.. code-block:: console

 $ flux run --env=OMPI_MCA_btl_base_verbose=99 -N2 -n4 ./hello

To list available MCA parameters containing the string ``_verbose`` use:

.. code-block:: console

 $ ompi_info -a | grep _verbose

.. _mvapich2_config:

How should I configure MVAPICH2 to work with Flux?
==================================================

These configuration options are pertinent if MPI programs are to be run
by Flux:

with-pm=hydra
   Select the built-in PMI-1 "simple" wire protocol client which matches
   the default PMI environment provided by Flux.

with-pm=slurm
   This disables the aforementioned PMI-1 client, even if hydra is also
   specified.  Do not use.

.. note::
   It appears that ``--with-pm=slurm`` is not required to run MPI programs
   under Slurm, although it is unclear whether there is a performance impact
   under Slurm when this option is omitted.

.. _mpi_init_problems:

Why is MPI_Init() failing/hanging?
==================================

If your MPI application is not advancing past ``MPI_Init()``, there may be a
problem with the PMI handshake which MPI uses to obtain process and networking
information.  To debug this, try getting a server side PMI protocol trace by
running your job with ``-o verbose=2``.  A healthy MPICH PMI handshake looks
something like this:

.. code-block:: console

Flux Developer Questions
************************

.. _message_callback_not_run:

My message callback is not being run. How do I debug?
=====================================================

* Check the error codes from ``flux_msg_handler_addvec``,
  ``flux_register_service``, ``flux_rpc_get``, etc
* Use ``FLUX_O_TRACE`` and ``FLUX_HANDLE_TRACE`` to see messages moving
  through the overlay
* ``FLUX_HANDLE_TRACE`` is set when starting a Flux instance:
  ``FLUX_HANDLE_TRACE=t flux start``
* ``FLUX_O_TRACE`` is passed as a flag to :core:man3:`flux_open`.
